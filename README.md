# CNN-Image-Classifier

🚀 Deep CNN Emotion Classifier: Happy vs. Sad

✨ Project in a Nutshell
This is an end-to-end Machine Learning project showcasing a custom-built Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary image classification.
Goal: Classify images as "Happy" or "Sad".
Model: Custom CNN built from scratch (TensorFlow/Keras).
Showcase: Deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.


🛠️ Key Technologies
TensorFlow/Keras: Model development.
Streamlit: Deployment and UI.
OpenCV: Data integrity and image processing.
